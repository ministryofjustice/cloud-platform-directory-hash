## Overview
At present the [cloud-platform-environments] repository requires a Cloud Platform engineer to manually review and approve every pull request. A large portion of these pull requests are generated by scripts or the [cloud-platform-cli] tool and take time and effort to review. The intention of this tool is to provide a way to automatically approve a pull request that has been deemed sufficiently standard.
